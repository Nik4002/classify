# classify
This Rust crate aims to provide easy-to-use functions and structs that can classify data through a variety of algorithms, including Jenks Natural Breaks, Quantile Breaks, and more. Feel free to reach out to me at 

Implemented as of version 0.1.2:
 * Functions: Jenks, Quantile
 * Structs: Bin and Classification
 * Other miscellaneous functionality

Expected future features:
 * Functions: Heads-Tails, Equal Interval, and more
 * Function to determine the bin in a Classification to which a particular data point belongs
 * Generalize data input types to include all float or numeric types, not just f64
